Design a simplified version of Github’s Issues page

A simplified version of Github issues page needs to be created (refer any public repo's Issues page).
 Ignore the items in the header (search, filtering, stars, etc.) and only focus on implementing the list of issues. 
 To begin with, first, collect open issues from Github’s API and display them in a list. After this,
  add a pagination control to facilitate navigation across a complete list of issues.

Optional: In case you also add a React Router, one should be able to navigate directly to a particular issue page of choice.
